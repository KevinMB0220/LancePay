# LancePay 💸

**Instant international payments for Nigerian freelancers — powered by Stellar and stablecoins.**

LancePay enables freelancers to receive payments from global clients in minutes, not days, with fees under 1%. Blockchain complexity is completely abstracted — users see invoices, balances, and bank withdrawals, nothing else.

## 🎯 What We're Building

A fintech platform that solves the biggest pain point for Nigerian freelancers: **receiving international payments quickly and cheaply**.

### The Problem
- Traditional payment methods (PayPal, Wise) have high fees (5-10%) and slow settlement (3-7 days)
- Nigerian freelancers lose significant portions of their earnings to fees and exchange rate markups
- Crypto solutions are too complex for non-technical users

### Our Solution
- **Create invoice** → Get shareable payment link
- **Client pays** → Card payment converts to USDC on Stellar
- **Instant settlement** → Funds arrive in 3-5 seconds
- **Withdraw to bank** → Convert to NGN via Yellow Card, instant bank transfer
- **Keep 99%+ of earnings** → Fees under 1%

**Zero crypto knowledge required** — users never see wallets, private keys, or blockchain jargon.
